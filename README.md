# Swim Acceleration Data Visualization
The goal of this project is to accurately visualize accelerometer data collected by swimmers to allow for additional critique of certain aspects of a swimmers stroke through the use of quantitative data.

## Goals
1. Successfully collect both acceleration data using WITMOTION accelerometers and video recording of swimmer
2. Calibrate and convert raw data into usable/useful products
3. Sync and display acceleration data and video recording together

### Successfully collect both acceleration data using WITMOTION accelerometers and video recording of swimmer
Status: IN PROGRESS

Problems:
- Not waterproof

Solutions:
- Create a reliable waterproof casing that can
  - fit in the fabric casing of a stretch chord belt
  - be easily removable
  - 

### Calibrate and convert raw data into usable/useful products
### Sync and display acceleration data and video recording together
