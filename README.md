# SwimSense
The goal of this project is to provide swimmers and coaches with all the resources they need to analyze their swimming technique through data. This project arose out of a desire of mine to improve my own technique, and was inspired by the work of Ken Ono and others with the University of Vrigina's Swim Team.

More sophisticated products exist that allow swimmers and coaches to analyze their technique through sensors, but the products are expensive and inexcessible to most. When I was looking for products, I came across this issue, which is why I designed this project to be open-source. The materials themselves are low-cost (especially compared to current products on the market), and the assembly is simple. A full guide to get started building your own prototype is included below. If you find any issues, please create a GitHub issue and I will try and fix it as soon as I can.

> NOTE: This project is under active development.

#### Bootload the Microcontroller
1. Connect the microcontroller to your computer via the USB-C to USB-C cable
2. An LED on the microcontroller should light up
3. Hold the two buttons down on the microcontroller
4. The LED should change colors/flash and a new drive should pop up on your computer named RPI-RP2
